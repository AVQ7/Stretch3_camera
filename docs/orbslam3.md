# Installing ORB-SLAM3

We use our own version of [ORBSLAM3](https://github.com/hello-atharva/ORB_SLAM3) and associated [python bindings](https://github.com/hello-atharva/ORB_SLAM3-PythonBindings). The following steps will guide you through the installation process.

You can find the [ORBSLAM3 installation instructions](https://github.com/hello-atharva/ORB_SLAM3/blob/main/INSTALL.md) in the appropriate repository.

## Using build scripts

There are two build scripts that you can run on the robot as well:

- [ORBSLAM3 build script](https://github.com/hello-atharva/ORB_SLAM3/blob/main/build.sh)
- [ORBSLAM3 ROS build script](https://github.com/hello-atharva/ORB_SLAM3/blob/main/build_ros.sh)
