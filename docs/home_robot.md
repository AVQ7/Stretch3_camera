# StretchPy with HomeRobot

Some demos use [HomeRobot](https://github.com/cpaxton/home-robot) for low-level control on the robot hardware, and use more AI features on whatever offboard compute you have available - for example a laptop with a GPU.

## Installation

To install HomeRobot, run the following on your Stretch:

```bash
# Install HomeRobot - TODO this is wrong
./install_home_robot.sh
```
